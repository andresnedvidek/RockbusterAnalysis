## Project Description: Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis
Objective
I am tasked with analyzing Rockbuster Stealth's data to uncover insights and suggest strategies for launching their new online video rental service. This analysis will help improve their competitive edge and target customer segments effectively.

# Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company, plans to launch an online video rental service to compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth’s BI department, my first task is to load all company data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and use SQL to analyze the data, providing insights for the launch strategy.

# Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board wants data-driven answers to the following questions for their 2020 strategy:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# Context
To address these questions, I will:
Load Rockbuster’s data into a PostgreSQL database.
Use SQL to query the data incrementally, answering increasingly complex business questions.
Visualize the results for easy consumption by Rockbuster management.

# Data Set
The data set includes information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments.
